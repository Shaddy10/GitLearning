The Nissan GT-R (Gran Turismo–Racing; model code: R35; Japanese: 日産・GT-R; Nissan GT-R) is a car built by Japanese marque Nissan since 2007. 
It has a 2+2 seating layout and is considered both a sports car and a grand tourer. 
The engine is front-mid mounted and drives all four wheels. 
It succeeds the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a faster variant of the Nissan Skyline. Although this model was the sixth-generation to bear the GT-R name, it is no longer part of the Skyline line-up. 
The car is built on the PM platform, derived from the FM platform used in the Skyline and Nissan Z models. 
Production is conducted in a shared production line at Nissan's Tochigi plant in Japan.
